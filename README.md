## My Initial Findings

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data (also called Anderson's Iris data set) set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems". The data set consists of 3 species of Iris plants with 150 samples, 50 from each. The species are Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica. The data contains the sepal length and width, and the petal length and width. So far I have used numpy and pandas to extrapolate some initial data to the console. The next goal is to put this data in a file and some further research. I used pandas.DataFrame.describe to get some extra data such as mean, standard deviation, max and min etc.

## Histograms

I added 4 histograms to the project using Seaborn. The 4 plots attached are petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width. The 3 Irises are on each plot.
